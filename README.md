This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Ravenous

Following a Codecademy tutorial, I created a React app that uses the Yelp API to search for businesses.

Components:
1. `<Business />` - represents how a restaurant will be formatted & styled
2. `<BusinessList />` - simulates what a returned list of businesses would like in Ravenous after querying the Yelp API
3. `<SearchBar />` - will communicate with the Yelp API
4. `<App />`
